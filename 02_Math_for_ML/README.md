# Mathematics for Machine Learning: The Core Foundations

A deep understanding of AI and Machine Learning is impossible without a solid grasp of the underlying mathematics. This folder is a collection of my notes and insights into the mathematical pillars that support the entire field.

Topics you can expect to find here include:

* **Linear Algebra:** The language of data and vectors.
* **Calculus:** The engine for optimization.
* **Probability & Statistics:** The framework for uncertainty and data analysis.

These notes are designed to connect the abstract mathematical concepts directly to their practical applications in machine learning, showing how they bring algorithms to life.
