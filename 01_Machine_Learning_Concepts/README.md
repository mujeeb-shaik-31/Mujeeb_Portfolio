# Machine Learning Concepts: In-Depth Notes

This folder is dedicated to building a foundational and intuitive understanding of core machine learning concepts and algorithms. Instead of just memorizing the "what," the notes here focus on the "how" and the "why."

Here you will find:

* **Personal Explanations:** My unique perspective and detailed breakdowns of how different algorithms work.
* **Mathematical Derivations:** Hand-drawn and explained derivations of key equations to solidify understanding.
* **Conceptual Insights:** Discussions on assumptions, limitations, and practical applications of each concept.

The goal is to move beyond superficial knowledge and document my journey toward becoming a researcher with a genuine grasp of the subject.
