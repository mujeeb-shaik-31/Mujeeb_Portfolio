# Mujeeb's AI & Data Science Portfolio

This repository serves as a live portfolio and a strategic knowledge hub documenting my journey into the deep foundations of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. As an aspiring researcher, I believe in building a robust understanding from the ground up, not just for exams but for genuine mastery. This portfolio is a testament to that philosophy.

### About This Portfolio
Unlike a typical project dump, this repository showcases my intellectual process and my quest for clarity. It contains my personal notes, detailed explanations of core concepts, and applied projects that reflect my strategic approach to learning. Here, you will find my unique perspective on how complex topics work, documented in a way that solidifies my knowledge and provides a transparent look into my academic journey.

### Repository Structure
The content is organized into key focus areas to make navigation straightforward:

* **01_Machine_Learning_Concepts**: This folder contains my in-depth explanations and analyses of core machine learning algorithms and principles. You will find my handwritten notes and personal insights that go beyond standard textbook definitions.

* **02_Math_for_ML**: The mathematical foundations are paramount to a true understanding of AI. This section is dedicated to my exploration of linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics, as they apply directly to machine learning.

### My Long-Term Vision
My mission is to become a high-level AI researcher, with a clear path toward a PhD at a top institution. This portfolio is a crucial part of that mission. My goal is to use this repository as a living resume that showcases not just what I've learned, but **how** I think, empowering me to pursue advanced studies and contribute to cutting-edge research in the field.

### Connect With Me
I believe in continuous learning and intellectual debate. If you have questions or feedback, or if you'd like to collaborate, I'm always open to a discussion.
